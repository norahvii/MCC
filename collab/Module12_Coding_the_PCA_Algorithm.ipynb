You can follow the steps provided in Part 3 of the instructions. However, keep in mind that there are various ways to visualize data, so feel free to explore different techniques and choose the approach that best suits your needs. This flexibility allows you to showcase the characteristics and patterns of your dataset effectively. Once you have visualized the data, you will gain insights into its structure and distribution, which will serve as a reference for comparison after dimensionality reduction."],"metadata":{"id":"Yfs6QY2h0ksf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Visualization of the data set\n","\n","############ Insert your own code here ############"],"metadata":{"id":"e6iSVBAD0sgD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Perform PCA on your own data set using your own PCA function."],"metadata":{"id":"49_R3_430tbX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Data Prperation\n","\n","############ Insert your own code here ############\n","\n","# PCA\n","\n","############ Insert your own code here ############"],"metadata":{"id":"TtSjYS780tOo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Visualize your dimensionality reduced data.
