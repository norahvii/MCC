This is the first day of the course, we are going to review trigonometry, discretization, and some approximation required to understand calculus. If you find the assigned problems difficult or if you have no prior knowledge of calculus, feel free to reach out. We are happy to provide you with more introductory materials that will allow you to focus on learning basic calculus concepts with more detail and time.

### Topics Covered

*   A Review of Trigonometry
*   Discrete Inputs to Continuous Functions
*   Computing and Calculus

### Topic 1: A Review of Trigonometry

âœ…**Task:** Read Chapter 1.5 (pg. 29-33). Complete the following **exercises: 2, 4, 11, 15, 16, 30** (pg. 33-34) and compare your work to the solutions (where possible).

### Topic 2: A Thousand Points of Light (Discrete Inputs to Continuous Functions)

âœ…**Task:** Read Chapter 1.6 (pg. 34-36); if you find any gaps in Strangâ€™s calculations in this section, fill them in with your own work.

### Topic 3: Computing in Calculus

âœ…**Task:** Read the first few pages of Chapter 1.7 (pg. 36-38), up to the statement of Example 8. Work through **examples 1-7** from this reading using (at least) one of the following tools:

*   MATLAB
*   Python
*   The desmos graphing calculator ([http://desmos.com/calculator](http://desmos.com/calculator))

**ðŸ’¡Pro-Tip:** Take notes on the main concepts & flag sections you have difficulties understanding. When moving forward you might be able to find answers on your own, otherwise, ask tutors and fellow students for help.
