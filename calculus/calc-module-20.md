### Topics Covered

*   Integral Change of Coordinates
*   Transformations of Random Variables

14.2 Change to Better Coordinates
---------------------------------

âœ…Â  **Task:** Read Chapter 14.2 (pg. 527-534). Complete the following **exercises: 15, 19, 22, 23** (pg. 334) and compare your work to the solutions (where possible).

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: If you get stuck on a concept or problem, ask a tutor or refer to the solution for a hint. Donâ€™t spend too long getting hung up on one point!

Transformations of Random Variables
-----------------------------------

âœ…Â  **Task:** Complete the exercises below. You may find it helpful to refer to Chapter 8.4 and Chapters 14.1-14.3 of Strang.

### Exercise

1\. Show that

![LaTeX: \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2} dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-u^2} du = 1](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Cfrac%257B1%257D%257B%255Csigma%255Csqrt%257B2%255Cpi%257D%257D%2520%255Cint_%257B-%255Cinfty%257D%255E%257B%255Cinfty%257D%2520e%255E%257B-x%255E2%252F2%255Csigma%255E2%257D%2520dx%2520%253D%2520%255Cfrac%257B1%257D%257B%255Csqrt%257B%255Cpi%257D%257D%2520%255Cint_%257B-%255Cinfty%257D%255E%257B%255Cinfty%257D%2520e%255E%257B-u%255E2%257D%2520du%2520%253D%25201?scale=1 "\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2} dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-u^2} du = 1")

_Hint_: Define the integral ![LaTeX: I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \; dx](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/I%253D%255Cint_%257B-%255Cinfty%257D%255E%255Cinfty%2520e%255E%257B-x%255E2%257D%2520%255C%253B%2520dx?scale=1 "I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \; dx") and write an expression for ![LaTeX: I^2](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/I%255E2?scale=1 "I^2") with two different dummy variables; use the coordinate transformation ![LaTeX: (x,y) \to (r,\theta)](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/(x%252Cy)%2520%255Cto%2520(r%252C%255Ctheta)?scale=1 "(x,y) \to (r,\theta)") to evaluate your expression for ![LaTeX: I^2](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/I%255E2?scale=1 "I^2").

2\. Suppose ![LaTeX: X \sim N(0,1)](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/X%2520%255Csim%2520N(0%252C1)?scale=1 "X \sim N(0,1)") is a stanard normal variable (i.e., ![LaTeX: f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/f_X(x)%2520%253D%2520%255Cfrac%257B1%257D%257B%255Csqrt%257B2%255Cpi%257D%257D%2520e%255E%257B-x%255E2%252F2%257D?scale=1 "f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}")) and define a new random variable ![LaTeX: Y = aX + b](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/Y%2520%253D%2520aX%2520%252B%2520b?scale=1 "Y = aX + b"). Compute ![LaTeX: f_Y](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/f_Y?scale=1 "f_Y") by computing ![LaTeX: F_Y](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/F_Y?scale=1 "F_Y") in terms of ![LaTeX: F_X](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/F_X?scale=1 "F_X") and differentating.

1.  1.  What type of distribution does the new random variable ![LaTeX: Y](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/Y?scale=1 "Y") have?
    2.  What are the mean and variance of ![LaTeX: f_Y](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/f_Y?scale=1 "f_Y")?
    3.  How does your result relate to problem 14.2.23 from Strangâ€™s text?
    4.  What do implications do your findings have for the importance of satisfying normality assumptions when using general linear models (GLMs)? If youâ€™re unsure, try repeating the above steps with ![LaTeX: f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}](https://wustl.instructure.com/equation_images/f_X(x)%2520%253D%2520%255Clambda%2520e%255E%257B-%255Clambda%2520x%257D?scale=1 "f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}") and seeing how your results differ.
