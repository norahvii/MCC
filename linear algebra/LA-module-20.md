### Topics Covered

*   Linear Separable Support Vector Machines

### Topic 1: Linear Separable Support Vector Machines

In this module, your task is to review the provided materials, which cover advanced concepts such as the Lagrangian multiplier. While we understand that you may not be familiar with these concepts, our aim is to provide you with an overview of the mathematics behind linearly separable SVM. There won't be any problem sets, but the quiz will include a general-level question on SVM.

If you're interested in diving deeper into the subject, we encourage you to do additional research or consider taking Machine Learning or Optimization courses that dedicate more time to introducing these concepts. However, be assured that in the upcoming modules, you will be able to follow the application of SVM and construct the algorithm without fully grasping all the details.

✅**Task:** Watch these three lectures from [Dr. Hak-Keung Lam](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/hak-keung-lam) (Kings College London) on YouTube that introduce the concept of SVM and the linearly separable case:

1.  1.  Support Vector Machines - Part 1: [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQEAR4u5vhI&ab_channel=HKLam)
    2.  Support Vector Machines - Part 2a: [Linearly Separable Case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpWwM8PzfnY&ab_channel=HKLam)
    3.  Support Vector Machines - Part 2b: [Linearly Separable Case (cont'd)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvn7m5HJbo&ab_channel=HKLam)

✅**Task:** \[Optional\]: Go through the reading materials.
