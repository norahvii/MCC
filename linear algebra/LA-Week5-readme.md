Welcome to Application of Support Vector Machines Week ðŸ™Œ!

The goal of this week is to apply the fundamentals you have learned in the past weeks to Support Vector Machines (SVM). This week will be a mix of coding in Python and discussing journal papers.

If you'd like additional feedback, you canÂ [submit your work from the modules here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1200 "[LA] Submission 5: Application of SVM")Â for review by the course tutors, or bring your questions to the tutoring sessions. You can also post any questions onÂ [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu)Â \- remember to use the Linear Algebra Week\_5\_application\_of\_SVM tag!Â
