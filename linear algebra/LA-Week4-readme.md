Welcome to Fundamentals for Support Vector Machines Week ðŸ™Œ!

This week weâ€™ll begin to explore support vector machines (SVM) by starting with the linear algebra fundamentals required to understand the mathematics behind the method. Below is the overview of the specific topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions.

If you'd like additional feedback, you canÂ [submit your work from the modules here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1199 "[LA] Submission 4: Fundamentals for SVM")Â for review by the course tutors, or bring your questions to the tutoring sessions. You can also post any questions onÂ [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu)Â \- remember to use the Linear Algebra week\_4\_fundamentals\_svm tag!Â 

You can test your knowledge from the week by taking theÂ [Fundamentals for SVM quiz](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1184 "[LA] Quiz 3: Fundamentals Support Vector Machines")!Â
