Welcome to week two of the Linear Algebra Module! We will now introduce you to fundamentals that are related to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This will hopefully give you a better understanding of the method or help you out before you are applying your knowledge to a small practical project next week.Â 

### Topics Covered

*   Eigenvectors and Difference Equations

### Topic 1: Inner Product, Length, and Orthogonality

âœ…**Task:**Â Read Section 6.1 (p. 332-338) and do **problems 19, 20, 24 & 29**. (p. 338-339).

### Topic 2: Orthogonal Sets

âœ…**Task:**Â Read Section 6.2 (p. 340-346) and do **problems 21, 24, 26, 27 & 29** (p. 346-348).

**ðŸ’¡Pro-Tip:**Â Focus on the process: Instead of just trying to achieve a certain outcome, focus on the process of learning itself. Embrace mistakes and challenges as opportunities for growth and learning.
