Welcome to Fundamentals of Principal Component Analysis Week ðŸ™Œ!

This week weâ€™ll begin to explore principal component analysis (PCA) by starting with the linear algebra fundamentals required to understand the mathematics behind the method. Below is the overview of the specific topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions.

If you'd like additional feedback, you canÂ [submit your work from the modules here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1197 "[LA] Submission 2: Fundamentals for PCA")Â for review by the course tutors, or bring your questions to the tutoring sessions. You can also post any questions onÂ [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu)Â \- remember to use the Linear Algebra week\_2\_fundamentals\_pca tag!Â 

You can test your knowledge from the week by taking the [Fundamentals for PCA quiz](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1190 "[LA] Quiz 2: Principal Component Analysis")!Â
