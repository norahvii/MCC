In this module, you will apply your knowledge from the past couple of modules to implement Support Vector Machine (SVM) using Python. The goal is to guide you through writing the algorithm from scratch using Python for a binary classification task. At the end of the module, you'll be asked to update three hyperparameters for the SVM algorithm and note the changes in accuracy, precision, and recall. 

#### **Instructions for using Google Colab:**

1.  Open the Google Colab File using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zehk0ztjFgB6O4lzOSknJ89e0TBMxuCa?usp=sharing "Link") and SAVE a COPY to your Drive.
2.  Run the provided code sections and follow the instructions. Implement your own code were indicated.
3.  If you run into error messages or get stuck, we highly recommend using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu) to ask your questions. This will help peers that might face similar problems. Please remember to tag your question with week\_5\_application\_of\_svm
