A note from the Summer Math Crash Course team:
Imaging Science Student Council’s [Math Crash Course](https://sites.wustl.edu/imagingsciences/summer-2023-math-crash-course/) is for students who need to learn, re-learn, or brush up on calculus, linear algebra, or functional analysis (signals and systems) before beginning coursework. These courses are designed for independent study through guided solutions and textbook materials.

Course Expectations:
These courses will not be graded.
Our goal is exposure, not mastery.
Work together whenever; doing so is helpful.
Don’t hesitate to ask one another and your tutors for help.

The math crash course is designed to be taken over the course of a 9-week curriculum; calculus and linear algebra are taken in parallel over the first 6 weeks, and functional analysis comprises the final 3 weeks. Each course is divided into daily modules, which typically assign both reading and practice problems (we recommend spending 2-3 hours on each module, or 2-3 hours per course per day). For each course, tutors will lead two problem sessions per week, where they’ll review key concepts and work through exercises.

We designed these courses as a self-study curriculum. While we have made an effort to curate the textbooks, modules, exercises (and more!) and provide structured ways to engage with them, how you use these resources is completely your decision! The timelines and content pacing reflect our best guess of what is helpful to you. If our guesses don’t work for you, feel free to reach out to us to make adjustments (or make them yourself).

These courses are here for you. Their purpose is to give you guided practice and community access as you learn, re-learn, or brush up on core engineering math skills. Some concepts and techniques may be difficult, especially if they are new. If you don’t quickly become comfortable with something new, don’t worry: you’ll have many chances to understand anything important enough to show up often.
