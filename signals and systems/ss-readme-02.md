This week (and our course!) will culminate in the statement of an important and powerful result: the _sampling theorem_. We’ll cover

*   linearity, time-shifting, conjugation, differentiation, and integration of the Fourier transform
*   scaling and duality in the Fourier transform
*   The Fourier convolution theorem
*   the sampling theorem

As always, remember: the goal of our course is exposure, not mastery! This week especially covers quite a bit of material; if you can’t take it all in, don’t worry. Whatever you can internalize on this pass through the material will help you the next time you see it!
