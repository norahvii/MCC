Today marks our first foray into the details of the Fourier transform; we will

*   cover its definition in the general case
*   examine the conditions of its defining integral’s convergence
*   consider a few important examples

**Reading:**

*   Oppenheim & Willsky: Section 4.1.1 (p. 288 only, from “Equations (4.8) and (4.9) are referred to as…”)
*   Oppenheim & Willsky: Section 4.1.2-3 (p. 288-296)

**Problems:**

*   Oppenheim & Willsky: 4.1(a)\*, 4.2 (p. 334)
