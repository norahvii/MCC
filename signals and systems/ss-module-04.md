=========================

We’ve seen what happens when we convolve with a delta function — we can recover a function perfectly! How closely do we get to approximate this in practice?

**Reading:**

*   Oppenheim & Willsky: Sections 2.1 and 2.2 (pg. 75-102). You only have to look at the first two examples in each section but feel free to work through them all if you need more practice.
*   Prince & Links: Section 2.3.2 (pg. 25)

**Problems:**

*   Oppenheim & Willsky: 2.3, 2.4, 2.21a/c, 2.22b
*   Prince & Links: 2.10
