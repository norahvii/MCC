The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem
====================================

Congratulations! You’ve reached the last day of the signals and systems course!

Today, we can introduce the result we’ve been building up to for the past few weeks: the (Nyquist-Shannon) _**sampling theorem**_.

**Reading:**

*   Oppenheim & Willsky: Read the introduction to chapter 7 and Section 7.1.1 (p. 514-520)

**Problems:**

*   Oppenheim & Willsky: 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.22 (p. 556-561)
