Introduction to Delta Functions and Complex Exponentials
========================================================

Welcome to the Signals and Systems course! We will be working out of Oppenheim & Willsky’s _Signals and Systems_ textbook.

Today, we meet two important types of functions (in a loose sense of the word): the delta “function” and the complex exponentials.
