Properties of the Fourier Transform (part 1)
============================================

We are now poised to start a thorough investigation into the properties of the Fourier transform. Today, we will examine its

*   linearity
*   time-shifting properties
*   behavior under (complex) conjugation
*   behavior with respect to differentiation
*   behavior with respect to integration
