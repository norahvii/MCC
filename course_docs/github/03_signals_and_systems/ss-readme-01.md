Welcome to the Signals & System course ðŸ™Œ! The goal of these modules is give you an exposure to key concepts in signal analysis and takes a more introductory approach. We will cover topics including the delta function, convolution and the Fourier transform. The modules will follow a similar format to previous courses: there will be an overview of the topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions. Best of luck on your journey!

As always, we recommend doing the listed readings and then attempting the practice questions. If you are already familiar with topic, feel free to skip to the questions to brush up on your understanding. If you are struggling with a concept or a question, make a post on piazza (make sure to select Signals & Systems Week 1 folder) or bring your question to one of the help sessions.
