Welcome to the first week of the Linear Algebra course ðŸ“£!Â 

This week weâ€™ll start by covering some of the fundamentals of linear algebra to prepare you for applications in principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machines (SVM). Below is the overview of the specific topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions.

This week we will introduce Google Colab for applying the fundamentals of linear algebra using Python. [You can access the Google Colab here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/pages/la-programming-practice-1-fundamentals "[LA] Programming Practice 1: Fundamentals ").Â 

If you'd like additional feedback, you can [submit your work from the modules here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1196 "[LA] Submission 1: Fundamentals") for review by the course tutors, or bring your questions to the tutoring sessions. You can also post any questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu) - remember to use the Linear Algebra Week\_1\_Fundamentals tag!Â 

You can test your knowledge from the week by taking the [Fundamentals quiz](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1182 "[LA] Quiz 1: Fundamentals ")!Â
