Welcome to Application of Principal Component Analysis Week ðŸ™Œ!

The goal of this week is to apply the fundamentals you have learned in the past weeks to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This week will be a mix of applied problem sets, reading and discussing journal papers as well as programming practice using Python in Google Colab.

If you'd like additional feedback, you canÂ [submit your work from the modules here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1198 "[LA] Submission 3: Application of PCA")Â for review by the course tutors, or bring your questions to the tutoring sessions. You can also post any questions onÂ [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu)Â \- remember to use the Linear Algebra Week\_3\_application\_of\_PCA tag!Â
