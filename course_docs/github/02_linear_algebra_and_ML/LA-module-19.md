### Before You Start

Don't get overwhelmed by the amount of content for today. Topic 1-3 are a revisit of Modules 4 and 4 from the first week. You should be familiar with the contents already, if not, don't worry, that's why we included them in this section. Revisit problems from the [Fundamentals Quiz](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/quizzes/350 "[LA] Quiz 1: Fundamentals ") â€” make sure youâ€™re very comfortable with the material covered by those problems before moving to Topic 4 (Chapter 8.4), which is an advanced extension of the same ideas.

### Topics Covered

*   Vector Spaces and Subspaces
*   Null Spaces, Column Spaces, and Linear Transformations

**ðŸ’¡Pro-Tip:**Â Great job! You should feel proud of yourself for all that you have accomplished so far. You have covered a lot of ground in this crash course, and although you may forget some concepts along the way, you will likely find that your understanding of the material has been consolidated in your memory over time. So, keep up the good work, and know that your efforts will pay off in the long run!
