In this module, you will apply your knowledge from the past couple of modules to implement Support Vector Machine (SVM) using built-in Python functions. The goal is to guide you through using built-in Python functions from scikit-learn, a popular machine learning toolbox for Python. You will utilize these functions to do binary classification on a randomly generated dataset and a real dataset. 

#### **Instructions for using Google Colab:**

1.  Open the Google Colab File using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vfWNKsp5l5q2HrhaZ0sx4SfsB1vJFb2s?usp=sharing "Link") and SAVE a COPY to your Drive.
2.  Run the provided code sections and follow the instructions. Implement your own code were indicated.
3.  If you run into error messages or get stuck, we highly recommend using [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu) to ask your questions. This will help peers that might face similar problems. Please remember to tag your question with week\_5\_application\_of\_svm. 
    

#### **This practice is divided into 2 Parts.**

*   Part 1: SVM using a randomly generated dataset
*   Part 2: SVM using a real dataset
