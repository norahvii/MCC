### Topic 1: Diagonalization of Symmetric Matrices

✅**Task:** Read Section  7.1 (p. 397-401) and do problems **4, 8, 16, 26, 28 & 37** (p. 401-402).

**💡Pro-Tip:** Pat yourself on the back, you are a Pro already! 🏆 Topics in this section will be introduced in classes like Mathematics of Imaging Science or Introduction to Machine Learning (although with less detail), so don’t worry if don’t understand everything just yet. Also, feel free to reach out to your tutors and/or fellow students for help.
