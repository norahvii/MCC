-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We will now explore the meaning of singular values and vectors in image compression following [this tutorial](https://scicoding.com/pca-using-python-image-compression/). We will use the sklearn PCA function for this module. However, feel free to use your custom function instead.

#### **Instructions for using Google Colab:**

1.  Open the Google Colab File using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nNaJI6h36V__ZNlXafY4gu-3Uhf7ByzR?usp=sharing) and SAVE a COPY to your Drive.
2.  Run the provided code sections and follow the instructions. Implement your own code were indicated.
3.  If you run into error messages or get stuck, we highly recommend using the [Discussion](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/discussion_topics/726 "[LA] Discussion: Application of PCA") to ask your questions. This will help peers that might face similar problems. 
    
4.  Submit your Google Colab file [here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1198 "[LA] Submission 3: Coding PCA Algorithm") to receive feedback on your PCA algorithm.

#### **This practice is divided into 4 Parts, with the last being optional.**

*   Part 1: Compress a single gray scale image using PCA
*   Part 2: How any principal components are needed to efficiently compress the image?
*   Part 3: Singular Vectors and Principal Components
*   \[OPTIONAL\] Part 4: Image Compression Unsing PCA of an image data set

_Note: Depending on your previous experience with Python and familiarity with PCA, Parts 1-3 may feel relatively straightforward. As a result, we have included an optional Part 4 to provide an additional challenge. If you are new to these concepts or prefer to focus on Parts 1-3, skip Part 4._
