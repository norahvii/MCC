In this module, you will apply your knowledge from the past couple of modules to explore the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using Python with a new dataset. The goal is to guide you through using the built-in SVM functions to do binary classification on a dataset of your choosing. You can use the Module 22 Google Colab for guidance.  

#### **Instructions for using Google Colab:**

1.  Open the Google Colab File using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xA3Z7wgQPG5R0yx3ejHHbu_rsu5iycje?usp=sharing "Link") and SAVE a COPY to your Drive.
2.  Run the provided code sections and follow the instructions. Implement your own code were indicated.
3.  If you run into error messages or get stuck, we highly recommend using [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu) to ask your questions. This will help peers that might face similar problems. Please remember to tag your question with week\_5\_application\_of\_svm. 
    
4.  Submit your Google Colab file [here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1200 "[LA] Submission 5: Application of SVM") to receive feedback on your SVM algorithm implementation.
