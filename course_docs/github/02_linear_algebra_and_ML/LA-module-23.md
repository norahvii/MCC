LA Module 23: SVM Feature Selection
-----------------------------------

In this module, you will apply your knowledge from the past couple of modules to explore feature selection for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using Python. The goal is to guide you through feature selection to help in filtering irrelevant or redundant features. Additionally, we will implement a stopping criterion to aid in improving our training efficiency. We will use feature selection and stopping criterion for the SVM algorithm in Module 21 and assess the impact for a classification task using a real-life data set.

#### **Instructions for using Google Colab:**

1.  Open the Google Colab File using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MllyMJN2wkaqa8w_dG7fZXGNIYZmSzn7?usp=sharing "Link") and SAVE a COPY to your Drive.
2.  Run the provided code sections and follow the instructions. Implement your own code were indicated.
3.  If you run into error messages or get stuck, we highly recommend using [PiazzaLinks to an external site.](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu) to ask your questions. This will help peers that might face similar problems. Please remember to tag your question with week\_5\_application\_of\_svm.
