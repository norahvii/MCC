Today we are going to look at PCA in a research context by reviewing and discussing an application of PCA in recent literature. Please choose **one** of the following papers to read and come prepared to discuss the following questions either on the discussion board or during the next tutoring session. 

Paper Choice 1: S. Baronti, A. Casini, F. Lotti, and S. Porcinai, "Multispectral imaging system for the mapping of pigments in works of art by use of principal-component analysis," Appl. Opt. **37**, 1299-1309 (1998) [multispectral\_imaging\_paintings\_pca.pdf](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/files/25278?wrap=1 "multispectral_imaging_paintings_pca.pdf")

Paper Choice 2: Yeung KY, Ruzzo WL. Principal component analysis for clustering gene expression data. Bioinformatics. 2001 Sep;17(9):763-74. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/17.9.763. PMID: 11590094.

**Discussion Questions**

*   What was the application of PCA in this journal article? 
*   How was PCA applied to this problem? Did the authors expand upon the PCA methods we discussed last week? 
*   What are some other applications you can think of for PCA after reading this paper? How might you use PCA in your research, or related to your research interests?
