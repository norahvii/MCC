LA Module 12: Coding the PCA Algorithm
--------------------------------------

In this module, you will apply your knowledge from the past couple of modules to implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python. The goal is to write the algorithm by yourself from scratch using Python. Next, you will utilize your PCA function to analyze the principal components of a real-life data set.

#### **Instructions for using Google Colab:**

1.  Open the Google Colab File using [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KbIDnAP9wZunROe8xuzjUk0WII6H0vAh?usp=sharing) and SAVE a COPY to your Drive.
2.  Run the provided code sections and follow the instructions. Implement your own code were indicated.
3.  If you run into error messages or get stuck, we highly recommend using the [Discussion](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/discussion_topics/726 "[LA] Discussion: Application of PCA") to ask your questions. This will help peers that might face similar problems. 
    
4.  Submit your Google Colab file [here](https://wustl-catalog.instructure.com/courses/254/assignments/1198 "[LA] Submission 3: Coding PCA Algorithm") to receive feedback on your PCA algorithm.

#### **This practice is divided into 4 Parts, with the last being optional.**

*   Part 1: Step-by-Step Guide for Coding Principal Component Analysis
*   Part 2: Write Your Own PCA Function
*   Part 3: Apply your PCA Function on the [IRIS dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html "Link")
*   \[OPTIONAL\] Part 4: Apply your PCA Function on Your Own Dataset 

_Note: Depending on your previous experience with Python and familiarity with PCA, Parts 1-3 may feel relatively straightforward. As a result, we have included an optional Part 4 to provide an additional challenge. If you are new to these concepts or prefer to focus on Parts 1-3, skip Part 4._
