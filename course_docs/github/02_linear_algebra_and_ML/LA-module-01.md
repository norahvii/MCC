This is the first day of the course, we are going to review some basic concepts of systems of linear equations. Please reach out, if you find the problems very difficult or if you have no prior knowledge of linear algebra. We are happy to provide you with more introductory materials that will allow you to focus on learning basic linear algebra concepts with more detail and time.

### Topics Covered

*   Existence of Solutions
*   Computation of Ax
*   Properties of the Matrix
*   Homogeneous Linear Systems
*   Parametric Vector Form
*   Solutions of Nonhomogeneous Systems

### Topic 1: THE MATRIX EQUATION Ax = b

âœ…**Task:**Â Read Section 1.4 (p. 35-40) and do **problems 5, 13 & 24** (p. 40-41).

### Topic 2: SOLUTION SETS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS

âœ…**Task:**Â Read Section 1.5 (p. 43-47) and do **problems 5, 23 & 24** (p. 48).

**ðŸ’¡Pro-Tip:**Â Take notes on the main concepts & flag sections you have difficulties understanding. When moving forward you might be able to find answers on your own, otherwise, ask tutors and fellow students for help.
