Welcome to the final week of the Calculus and Probability course ðŸ“£! This week weâ€™ll finish up some more complex integration concepts and then continue our investigation into applications in probability.

Below is the overview of the specific topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions.

Note that some of this week's exercises are written out here on Canvas since they are not from the textbook. Post any questions you have on [piazza (make sure to select the Calculus Week 4 folder)](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu/create) orÂ bring them to the help sessions!
