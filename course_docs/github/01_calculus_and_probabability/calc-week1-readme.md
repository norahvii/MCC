-------------------------------------

Welcome to the Calculus course ðŸ™Œ! The goal of these modules is to make you more familiar with concepts you will encounter within your first-year courses.

We will begin by talking about the key ideas behind calculus and reviewing some fundamentals that will later become applicable. The modules will follow a similar format as you see below. There will be an overview of the topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions. Best of luck on your journey!

This first week will focus on gaining an understanding of derivatives and understanding some of the associated rules. Generally, we recommend doing the listed readings and then attempting the practice questions. If you are already familiar with topic, feel free to skip to the questions to brush up on your understanding. If you are struggling with a concept or a question, make a post on [piazza (make sure to select Calculus Week 1 folder)](https://piazza.com/class/li3om30wsqx4yu/create)Â or bring your question to one of the help sessions.
