*   Mean Value Theorem (MVT)
*   Lâ€™HÃ´pitalâ€™s Rule

### Topic 1: Linear Approximation

âœ…**Task:** Read Chapter 3.1 (p.91-95). Complete the following **exercises: 2, 8, 20** (p.95-96) and compare your work to the solutions (where possible).Â 

### Topic 2: The Mean Value Theorem and Lâ€™HÃ´pitalâ€™s Rule

âœ…**Task:** Read Chapter 3.8 (p.146-153). Complete the following **exercises: 8, 16, 25** (p.152-153) and compare your work to the solutions (where possible).Â 

**ðŸ’¡Pro-Tip:** Learning new things can be hard, so donâ€™t worry if you find problems difficult or cannot find the answer. Aim for being able to solve 70-80% of the problems correctly - if you reached the goal, move on!
