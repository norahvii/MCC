Welcome to Week 3 of the Calculus course ðŸ¤ ! This page is an overview of the topics covered, followed by more detailed steps on associated readings, additional materials, and review questions.

This week, we introduce the integral and learn about its properties and we also start to investigate some problems in probability.
